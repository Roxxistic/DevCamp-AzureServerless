# O02: Operating Surveillance
## Goal
The deployed application contains several errors and flaws. Can you provide a simple mechanism to find them? How can the support team be notified (in an appropriate way) when criticial errors occur systematically?

Additionally you may take care of the impact of the load to costs and performance. How can this relationship be measured and the operations team be informed?

## Potential Tools / Azure Services

# O03: Business Intelligence
## Goal
Provide all relevant business data in Power BI for custom analytics. How can they be extracted and imported from different sources? Can you extend those data with operational insights (such as current costs or the timestamp of last releases/changes)?

Based on your concept you may generate a dashboard for demonstration (including e.g. range of skills from all users). Additional you can setup an automated actualization of the dataset.

## Potential Tools / Azure Services
